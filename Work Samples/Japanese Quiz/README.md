# Capstone Project
## Author: Cody Perdue, Dr. Gary Newell

This is my senior capstone project created for the Northern Kentucky University Honors College. The thesis is titled *"Using Artificial Intelligence Techniques to Generate Quizzes Tailored to the User"* and consists of two executable java files, one which creates and gives a quiz generated by a list of inputted questions and parameters, and the other which takes the quiz score and generates a tailored quiz with new parameters. Two classes serve for project structure, the "questions" folder holds the question input as text files, "numbers.txt" is the generated input file for making the quiz, and "results.txt" is the generated input file for creating the next set of parameters.

A full rundown of the project can be found in the "Capstone Written Component" Word document.

# CS50 Assignments

Here is the work I did on Harvard's "CS50's Introduction to Game Development" course. The "Assignment Objectives" Word document explains what I had to modify or add to each game to complete the assignment. The "Code" folder contains a few code snippets of my work. Down below is a link to an unlisted YouTube playlist of my work.

This link leads to my unlisted playlist of Harvard's "CS50's Introduction to Game Development" course. The description of each video provides timestamps for our assigned changes to the game. The playlist is in order from newest to oldest, with the first 3 being made in Unity and the rest being made in Lua and LOVE2D.
